# Railroader InterchangeUnchained Mod
Please Read this **ENTIRE** README before continuing.

This is a mod for Railroader which is available on Steam.

This mod requires Railloader by Zamu.

## Usage
1. Download and install Railloader by Zamu from here: https://railroader.stelltis.ch/
    * Verify you have a Mods folder in the root of your railroader directory. If You do NOT have a Mods folder, you didn't complete this step successfully.
2. Download the InterchangeUnchained_v2.x.x.zip from the Releases Page of this repo.
3. There are 2 ways to install this mod.
    * ONLY DO ONE OF THE BELOW STEPS, NOT BOTH
    1. Open the zip folder, select the entire contents of the folder and drag the contents to the ROOT Railroader directory.
        * this should put a InterchangeUnchained folder into the Mods folder created in step 1
    2. Drag the zip file onto Railloader.exe and have Railloader install the mod.
        * as with option 1, this will put a InterchangeUnchained folder into the Mods folder created in step 1
    * If you DO NOT have the InterchangeUnchained folder in the Mods folder after completing ONE of the above steps, you didn't complete the step successfully.
3. Run the game and enjoy all of you interchange tracks being used.

## Notes
1. This mod currently supports Railroader verison 2024.2.2. This mod may break in future updates. I will do my best to continue to update this mod.
2. It is possible that the developers of Railroader will implement their own fix for this issue. At such time this mod will be deprecated and no longer maintained. This has happened once with the release of Railroader v2024.2.2 and I have decided to revitilize the mod rather than depricating it.
3. As the saying goes, use mods at your own risk.

## FAQ
### What does this mod do?
**PLEASE READ AS THE WAY THIS MOD FUNCTIONS HAS CHANGED FROM PRIOR VERSIONS**

Currently the game caps you at using 70% of the space in the interchange when it gets serviced. This mod changes this cap to 100%.

### Does this work in Multiplayer?
Yes, only if the Host has the mod. Initial tests indicate that other players do not need the mod, even if they increment time to service the interchange. If the host does not have the mod, then it will not work.

### What version of Railroader does this mod work with?
2024.2.2


Special thanks and credit to Zamu for creating Railloader and for help with making the mod a bit more robust.
