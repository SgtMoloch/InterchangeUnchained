## FAQ
### What does this mod do?
 Currently in the game, all interchanges, regardless of their number of tracks, only recieve cars on 2 of the tracks. This mod makes it so that all avaiable interchange tracks are used. This means all 3 tracks at the Sylva Interchange and all 4 tracks at the Andrews Interchange. Whittier Interchange is unaffected because it only has 2 avaiable tracks.

### Does this work in Multiplayer?
Yes, only if the Host has the mod. Initial tests indicate that other players do not need the mod, even if they increment time to service the interchange. If the host does not have the mod, then it will not work.

### What version of Railroader does this mod work with?
2023.3.1



Special thanks and credit to Zamu for creating Railloader and for help with making the mod a bit more robust.
